# DevTinder Project Development (LLD HLD)

## Development Approach
The DevTinder app is being built by following a structured development cycle similar to how projects are managed in a company. The process includes gathering requirements, high-level design (HLD), and low-level design (LLD).

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Understanding the Project**:
  - **Project Name**: DevTinder
  - **Concept**: A platform similar to Tinder, but specifically designed for developers to connect and collaborate.

- **Features**:
  1. **User Account Management**:
     - Create an account.
     - Signup and login functionality.
     - Update user profile.
  2. **Developer Exploration**:
     - Feed page to explore developer profiles.
     - Ability to send connection requests.
  3. **Connections Management**:
     - View matches (mutual connections).
     - List of sent and received requests.
     - Update profile information.
  4. **Additional Features**:
     - More features to be added according to development needs.

### 2. High-Level Design (HLD)
- **Tech Planning**:
  - **Architecture**: The app will follow a microservices architecture with separate services for the frontend and backend.
  - **Tech Stack**:
    - **Frontend**: React.js
    - **Backend**: Node.js
    - **Database**: MongoDB

- **Development Team Roles**:
  - Once the features and tech planning are finalized, the software development team comes into the picture, including SDE1, SDE2, and backend teams.

- **Note**:
  - Proper planning is essential, as it makes the development process smoother and coding easier.

### 3. Low-Level Design (LLD)
- **Database Design**:
  - **Collections**:
    1. **User**:
       - Fields: `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `password`, `age`, `gender`, etc.
    2. **ConnectionRequest Collection**:
       - Fields: `fromUserId` (sender's user ID), `toUserId` (receiver's user ID), `status` (e.g., pending, accepted, rejected, ignored).


### API Design
#### What are REST APIs?
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, most commonly HTTP.
- **REST APIs** are web services that allow for interaction between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods. They enable the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of resources through well-defined endpoints.

#### How REST APIs Work
1. **Client Request**:
   - The client sends a request to the server via HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.
   - Each HTTP method corresponds to a specific operation:
     - **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
     - **POST**: Create new data on the server.
     - **PUT**: Update existing data (entirely replace the resource).
     - **PATCH**: Partially update existing data.
     - **DELETE**: Remove data from the server.

2. **Server Response**:
   - The server processes the request and returns a response.
   - The response usually includes a status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found) and, if applicable, data in JSON or XML format.

3. **Stateless Communication**:
   - Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
   - The server does not store any state about the client session between requests.

#### Difference Between PUT and PATCH
- **PUT**: Updates the entire resource with new data. If any fields are missing, they may be reset or removed.
- **PATCH**: Only updates specific fields of the resource, leaving the other fields unchanged.

### REST APIs Needed
1. **User Management APIs**:
   - `POST /signup`: Register a new user
   - `POST /login`: Authenticate and login the user
   - `POST /profile`: Create a user profile
   - `GET /profile`: Retrieve user profile details
   - `PATCH /profile`: Update user profile
   - `DELETE /profile`: Delete user profile

2. **Connection Management APIs**:
   - `POST /sendRequest`: Send a connection request (ignore/interested)
   - `POST /reviewRequest`: Accept or reject a connection request
   - `GET /request`: Retrieve the list of requests (sent and received)
   - `GET /connections`: Get a list of established connections

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the database schema and API design.
2. Implement the backend services for the listed APIs.
3. Develop the frontend to interact with these backend services.
4. Test the application for feature completion and bug fixes.
