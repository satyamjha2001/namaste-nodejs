# Microservices vs Monolith - How to build a project

# Software Project Development in the Industry

## Waterfall Model Overview
The Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process that consists of a series of steps. Each step must be completed before moving on to the next. This model is one of the traditional approaches used in the software industry for project development.

### Steps in the Waterfall Model

1. **Requirement**
   - Gather and analyze all project requirements.
   - Document the functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Stakeholders provide input to ensure a clear understanding of the project's needs.
   - **Roles Involved**: Business Analysts, Project Managers, Stakeholders, Product Owners

2. **Design**
   - Create a system and software design based on the requirements.
   - Architectural design: High-level system structure.
   - Detailed design: Specifies how each component will work.
   - **Roles Involved**: Solution Architects, UX/UI Designers, System Designers, Technical Leads

3. **Development**
   - Actual coding of the software begins based on the design documents.
   - Development teams implement functionalities and integrate different modules.
   - **Roles Involved**: Software Developers, Backend/Frontend Developers, Database Administrators, DevOps Engineers

4. **Testing**
   - Perform testing to identify defects and bugs.
   - Different testing methods include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
   - **Roles Involved**: Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, Testers, Test Leads, Automation Engineers

5. **Deployment**
   - Once testing is successful, the software is deployed to a live environment.
   - The deployment phase includes user training and system configuration.
   - **Roles Involved**: DevOps Engineers, System Administrators, Release Managers, IT Support

6. **Maintenance**
   - Ongoing support for the software post-deployment.
   - Fixing any issues that arise and implementing necessary updates or enhancements.
   - **Roles Involved**: Support Engineers, Maintenance Team, Developers, IT Support, Customer Support

# Project Building Strategies

## Overview
There are two main architectural approaches to building software projects: Monolith and Microservices. Each has its own characteristics, advantages, and challenges. Understanding the parameters that differentiate these architectures is essential for selecting the right approach for a given project.

### 1. Monolith Architecture
- A single unified codebase where all components are interconnected.
- Easier to deploy since the entire application is packaged and released as a single unit.
- Suitable for smaller projects or applications with tightly coupled components.

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- A distributed system where different functionalities are separated into individual services.
- Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- Ideal for large, complex projects where different teams handle different services.

## Comparison Parameters

| Parameter           | Monolith Architecture                                          | Microservices Architecture                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Development Speed** | Faster for small projects; a single codebase is easy to manage. | May be slower initially due to service setup and communication.|
| **Code Repo**         | Single code repository for the entire project.                | Multiple repositories for individual services.                 |
| **Scalability**       | Limited to scaling the entire application.                    | Fine-grained scaling; each service can be scaled independently.|
| **Tech Stack**        | Typically a unified stack across the project.                 | Allows different tech stacks for different services.           |
| **Infra Cost**        | Lower for small projects with simpler requirements.           | Higher due to separate services and infrastructure overhead.   |
| **Complexity**        | Simpler for smaller projects but grows complex with size.     | Higher complexity due to distributed nature and inter-service communication. |
| **Fault Isolation**   | Failures can affect the entire application.                   | Better fault isolation; issues in one service do not impact others.|
| **Testing**           | Easier to perform end-to-end testing in a single environment.  | Requires testing multiple independent services and integration.|
| **Ownership**         | Centralized; a single team usually manages the entire application. | Distributed; different teams can own different services.       |
| **Maintenance**       | Easier for small projects but harder as the project grows.    | More manageable for large projects with well-defined services. |
| **Revamps**           | Difficult to change or refactor large monoliths.              | Easier to revamp individual services without affecting others. |
| **Debugging**         | Easier in a single codebase but can be challenging for large apps. | More difficult due to distributed logging and monitoring.      |
| **Developer Experience** | Easier for small teams working on a single codebase.        | Better for large teams as they can work independently on different services.|

## Conclusion
Choosing between Monolith and Microservices depends on project size, team structure, and specific requirements. Monolith architecture is simpler for smaller projects, while Microservices offer greater flexibility and scalability for larger, complex projects.
