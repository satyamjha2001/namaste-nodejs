# Understanding libuv and event loop

## The event loop in LIBUV operates in four major phases:
![Event loop phases](./images/Event%20loop%20Phases.png)

1  **Timers Phase:** In this phase, all callbacks that were set using  `setTimeout` or `setInterval` are executed. These timers are checked, and if their time has expired, their corresponding callbacks are added to the callback queue for execution.

2  **Poll Phase:** After timers, the event loop enters the Poll phase, which is crucial because it handles I/O callbacks. For instance, when you perform a file read operation using `fs.readFile` , the callback associated with this I/O operation will be executed in this phase. The Poll phase is responsible for handling all I/Orelated tasks, making it one of the most important phases in the event loop.

3  **Check Phase:** Next is the Check phase, where callbacks scheduled by the `setImmediate` function are executed. This utility API allows you to execute callbacks immediately after the Poll phase, giving you more control over the order of operations.

4  **Close Callbacks Phase:** Finally, in the Close Callbacks phase, any callbacks associated with closing operations, such as socket closures, are handled. This phase is typically used for cleanup tasks, ensuring that resources are properly released.

### One More Important Note
*When the event loop is empty and there are no more tasks to execute, it enters the `poll phase` and essentially waits for incoming events*
