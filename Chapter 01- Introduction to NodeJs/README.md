# **Namaste Node.js - Episode 1 Summary**  

## **Chapter 01: Introduction to Node.js**  

### **1. What is Node.js?**  
- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's **V8 engine**.  
- It allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, making it a powerful tool for various applications beyond web development.  

### **2. Key Features of Node.js**  

#### **a) Runtime Environment**  
- Node.js provides a **runtime environment** to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.  
- It is powered by the **V8 engine**, the same engine used in Google Chrome.  

#### **b) Event-Driven Architecture**  
- Node.js follows an **event-driven architecture**, efficiently handling asynchronous operations.  
- This design allows it to manage multiple tasks without waiting for one to complete before starting another.  

#### **c) Asynchronous I/O (Non-blocking I/O)**  
- Node.js performs **asynchronous I/O operations**, meaning tasks like reading/writing files or making network requests do not block the execution of other operations.  
- This is different from traditional synchronous programming, where tasks are executed sequentially.  

### **3. Development History of Node.js**  

#### **a) Creation and Early Development**  
- **Ryan Dahl** developed Node.js in **2009**.  
- Initially, he experimented with **SpiderMonkey**, Mozilla’s JavaScript engine, but later adopted Google’s **V8 engine** for its performance.  
- The project was originally named **web.js** but was later renamed **Node.js** to reflect its broader potential.  

#### **b) Support from Joyent**  
- **Joyent**, a technology company, saw potential in Node.js and supported its development.  

### **4. Comparison with Traditional Servers**  
- Before Node.js, most web servers used the **Apache HTTP Server**, which followed a **blocking I/O** model, limiting the number of concurrent connections.  
- Node.js introduced a **non-blocking I/O** model, allowing it to handle multiple requests efficiently with fewer system resources.  

### **5. The Evolution of NPM (Node Package Manager)**  
- **NPM** is a package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install and manage libraries easily.  
- Developed by **Joyent** in **2010**, it was initially available for **macOS and Linux**.  
- In **2011**, Microsoft collaborated to bring NPM to **Windows**.  

### **6. Leadership and Community Transitions**  

#### **a) Leadership Changes**  
- In **2012**, **Ryan Dahl** stepped down, and **Isaac Z. Schlueter**, the creator of NPM, took over Node.js development.  

#### **b) The io.js Fork and Reunification**  
- In **2014**, due to internal disagreements, **Fedor Indutny** forked Node.js and created **io.js**.  
- In **2015**, the Node.js and io.js communities resolved their conflicts, merging back into a single project.  

#### **c) Formation of the OpenJS Foundation**  
- By **2019**, the **JS Foundation** and **Node.js Foundation** merged, forming the **OpenJS Foundation**, ensuring long-term community-driven development.  

### **7. Present and Future of Node.js**  
- Node.js continues to evolve with strong community support, making it one of the most popular JavaScript runtimes.  
- Its ecosystem, powered by **NPM**, provides a vast collection of libraries for building scalable and efficient applications.
